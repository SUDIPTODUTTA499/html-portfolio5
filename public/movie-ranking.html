<h1>The Best Movies According To Sudipto </h1>
<h2>My Top 3 Movies of all time are</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Lunch Box</h3>
<p>
Loved it to bits. Ritesh Batra and his staff deserve immense credit and appreciation for this gem. I don't know why I kept delaying watching this movie even when it was accessible but I guess the wait and the procrastination made it sweeter and enjoyable.
The Lunchbox is a beautiful, quirky little story of friendship between two people who meet by chance but end up discovering a connection amongst each other's problems and insecurities. Irfaan khan's portrayal of Sajan Fernandes, a subdued middle-aged man is just genius. Nimrat Kaur holds her own with her elegant performance and Nawazuddin Siddique is charming in his part as Afzal Sheikh.
Overall The Lunchbox is a beautifully unique story that endears and engages you in its simple, gentle way and one that will leave you wanting more in the end.

<h3>Tumbaad</h3>
<p>
    Saw the movie tumbaad day before yesterday and realise  that I am still  in  the world of tumbaad. Metaphors  are beautifully  used to presented in the frame shown in movie like scene where broken jhula or swing (jhopala)  indicates the weakened  body of vinayak rao  due to frequently  visiting  kotha (brothel),ageing and also because of efforts taken by  him  to gain gold coins from tumbaads wada.In first half     scenes  are in dark which some audience  cannot understand  but it is demand of script due to pre and post independence  era or time shown.Sets and costumes are beautifully  done keeping authenticity  of that era. Audience cannot differentiate  between  actual location and sets. What I dont like was the scene  where vinayak takes his son to kotha .we should appreciate  and thanks to whole team of this movie for making such different  film in India and hindi .Hats off  to all cast and crew members. We must watch this movie so that more movie like this will be made in future in Bolly wood.Hatsoff to child who plays vinayak son   (mohammad samad ) for playing great grandmothers role also in the movie4/5

<h3>Brahmayugam</h3>
<p>
    "Bramayugam" is a chilling Malayalam horror film, anchored by a powerful Mammootty performance, that explores the dark underbelly of Kerala's feudal past through a haunting tale of a mysterious mansion, where a trapped folk singer confronts the sinister secrets of its inhabitants, leaving the audience unnerved by its atmospheric tension and unsettling climax.
